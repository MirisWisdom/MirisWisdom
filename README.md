### Howdy there ğŸ‘‹

**MirisWisdom/MirisWisdom** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) currently has nothing exciting in it to say.

Eventually it will have something pretty and informative, but until then:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this readme, enterprise software and some nifty projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how to read a delicious readme.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on almost anything, especially if written in C#
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making a more exciting readme.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding server and data administration.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: me@miris.design
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: yes
- âš¡ Fun fact: I went from avoiding Git 10 years ago, to now offering lectures about it to students who are avoiding Git, yet may one day offer lectures about it.
