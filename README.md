### Howdy there 👋

**MirisWisdom/MirisWisdom** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) currently has nothing exciting in it to say.

Eventually it will have something pretty and informative, but until then:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on this readme, enterprise software and some nifty projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to write a delicious readme.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything, especially if written in C#
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making a more exciting readme.
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding server and data administration.
- 📫 How to reach me: me@miris.design
- 😄 Pronouns: yes
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went from avoiding Git 10 years ago, to now offering lectures about it to students who are avoiding Git, yet may one day offer lectures about it.
